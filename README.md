This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the
>50K group or <=50K group.</p>
<br>

<h2>Approach:</h2> The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
